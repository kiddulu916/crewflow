## Core Features (Solving Competitor Gaps)

### Feature 1: Smart Duplication Engine (AI-Powered)
**Problem Solved**: "20 screen presses to enter the same daily data"

**How It Works**:
1. **Smart Yesterday Button**: One tap shows yesterday's entry with today's date
2. **Pattern Learning**: After 3 days, AI predicts your likely entry
3. **Crew Templates**: Save frequent combinations (crew + site + tasks)
4. **Voice Entry**: "Same as yesterday" works via voice command
5. **Bulk Actions**: Clock in entire crew to same site with 2 taps

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Pseudocode for Smart Duplication
function generateSmartSuggestion(workerId, currentDate) {
  const history = getLast7Days(workerId);
  const dayOfWeek = currentDate.getDay();
  
  // Check if same day of week pattern exists
  const sameDayEntries = history.filter(h => h.date.getDay() === dayOfWeek);
  
  if (sameDayEntries.length >= 2) {
    // High confidence pattern found
    return {
      confidence: 0.95,
      suggestion: mostCommonEntry(sameDayEntries),
      reason: "You worked here last 2 Mondays"
    };
  }
  
  // Fall back to yesterday
  return {
    confidence: 0.75,
    suggestion: history[0],
    reason: "Same as yesterday"
  };
}
```

**UI Design**:
- Green "Quick Start" button on home screen
- Shows preview: "Start work at Miller Residential - Rough Electrical?"
- One tap to confirm, swipe right to modify

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: GPS drains phone battery  
**Mitigation**: Intelligent GPS (only track during work hours, adaptive ping rate)

**Risk**: Offline sync conflicts  
**Mitigation**: Last-write-wins with manual conflict resolution UI

**Risk**: Integration breaks  
**Mitigation**: Daily health checks, automatic rollback, fallback to CSV export

**Risk**: Scalability (1000+ users per customer)  
**Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling, caching layer, database sharding plan

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Low adoption (workers won't use it)  
**Mitigation**: Obsessive focus on UX, foreman incentives, gamification

**Risk**: High churn (customers leave after 3 months)  
**Mitigation**: Proactive onboarding, success metrics tracking, 90-day check-ins

**Risk**: Can't compete with free/cheap options  
**Mitigation**: Emphasize ROI (saves 10 hrs/week = $500+/week value)

**Risk**: Marketplace has no workers  
**Mitigation**: Launch in one city, recruit workers directly, contractor subsidies

### Regulatory Risks

**Risk**: Labor law compliance varies by state  
**Mitigation**: Configurable rules engine, legal review per state, regular updates

**Risk**: Data privacy (GDPR, CCPA)  
**Mitigation**: SOC 2 Type II certified, data encryption, user data export tools

**Risk**: Worker classification (employee vs. contractor)  
**Mitigation**: Clear terms of service, contractor responsibility for classification
