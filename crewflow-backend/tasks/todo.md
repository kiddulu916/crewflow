# Task 3: Companies API Implementation (Phase 2)

## Overview
Implemented Companies API with GET and PUT endpoints following TDD principles.

## Tasks
- [x] Write failing service tests for CompanyService
- [x] Run tests to verify they fail
- [x] Implement CompanyService with getCompany and updateCompany methods
- [x] Run service tests to verify they pass
- [x] Create CompanyController with GET and PUT endpoints
- [x] Create company routes with authentication and RBAC
- [x] Mount company routes in index.ts
- [x] Write integration tests for Companies API
- [x] Run all tests to verify everything passes

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 41 passed (6 test suites)
- **Service Tests**: 7 tests for CompanyService (all passing)
- **Integration Tests**: 7 tests for Company API (all passing)
- **Time**: 10.222 seconds

## Files Created
1. `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/services/company.service.ts`
   - `getCompany(id)` - Fetch company by ID with deleted check
   - `updateCompany(id, data)` - Update company name, subscriptionTier, or settings
   - Uses NotFoundError for missing companies

2. `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/controllers/company.controller.ts`
   - `getCompany` - GET endpoint returning company details
   - `updateCompany` - PUT endpoint for updating company
   - Proper error handling with 404 and 500 status codes

3. `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/routes/company.routes.ts`
   - GET `/` - Authenticated, returns company for current user's companyId
   - PUT `/` - Authenticated + MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS permission (OWNER/ADMIN only)

4. `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/services/company.service.test.ts`
   - 7 service-level tests covering all methods and edge cases

5. `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/company.api.test.ts`
   - 7 integration tests covering GET/PUT endpoints
   - Tests authentication requirements (401)
   - Tests RBAC permissions (403 for FIELD_WORKER)
   - Tests successful operations with OWNER and ADMIN roles

## Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/index.ts`
  - Added import for companyRoutes
  - Mounted at `/api/v1/company`

## Key Implementation Details
1. **TDD Approach**: Wrote failing tests first, then implemented features
2. **RBAC Security**: PUT endpoint requires MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS permission (OWNER/ADMIN only)
3. **Company Scoping**: Uses companyId from JWT token (req.user.companyId)
4. **Soft Delete Support**: Filters out deleted companies (deletedAt: null)
5. **Error Handling**: Uses custom NotFoundError class for consistency

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/v1/company
- **Auth**: Required (any authenticated user)
- **Returns**: Company details for user's company
- **Status Codes**: 200 (success), 401 (unauthorized), 404 (not found), 500 (server error)

### PUT /api/v1/company
- **Auth**: Required + MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS permission (OWNER/ADMIN)
- **Body**: { name?, subscriptionTier?, settings? }
- **Returns**: Updated company object
- **Status Codes**: 200 (success), 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 500 (server error)

## Security Verification
- All authenticated users can view their company details (GET)
- Only OWNER and ADMIN roles can update company (PUT)
- FIELD_WORKER, FOREMAN, PROJECT_MANAGER roles receive 403 Forbidden on PUT
- Tests verify proper authentication (401) and authorization (403) responses

---

# Add Missing RBAC Authorization Tests (Code Review Critical Issue)

## Problem
Critical security gap: No tests verify that users WITHOUT MANAGE_USERS permission are blocked from POST, PUT, DELETE operations on the User API.

## Analysis
- Current tests in `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/user.api.test.ts` only test with ADMIN role (has MANAGE_USERS permission)
- FIELD_WORKER role does NOT have MANAGE_USERS permission (confirmed in `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/utils/rbac.ts`)
- Need to add tests that verify 403 Forbidden responses when FIELD_WORKER attempts privileged operations

## Tasks
- [x] Create FIELD_WORKER test user with authentication in the test setup
- [x] Add test: POST /api/v1/users - 403 for FIELD_WORKER
- [x] Add test: PUT /api/v1/users/:id - 403 for FIELD_WORKER
- [x] Add test: DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - 403 for FIELD_WORKER
- [x] Run tests to verify all new tests pass
- [x] Cleanup FIELD_WORKER user in afterAll hook

## Implementation Notes
- Keep tests simple and focused - one assertion per test
- Reuse the FIELD_WORKER token across all three new test cases
- Follow existing test patterns in the file
- Verify 403 status code and "Insufficient permissions" error message

## 2. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Architecture & Design Patterns

**STRENGTHS:**
1. **Clean Layered Architecture**: Proper separation (Routes → Controller → Service → Database)
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one clear purpose
3. **DRY Principle**: Reusable error classes, middleware, and utilities
4. **Consistent Patterns**: All controllers follow identical error handling patterns
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing throughout

**SERVICE LAYER QUALITY:**

**UserService** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/services/user.service.ts`):
- Strong encapsulation with private `sanitizeUser` method (lines 7-10)
- Proper use of transactions in `updateUser` (lines 105-118)
- Consistent error handling with custom exceptions
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds - industry standard)
- Company scoping on all operations for multi-tenancy

**CompanyService** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/services/company.service.ts`):
- Simple, focused methods
- Duplicate validation on update (lines 25-34)
- Soft delete awareness

**CONTROLLER LAYER QUALITY:**

**UserController** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`):
- Comprehensive error handling (ConflictError, NotFoundError, ValidationError)
- Proper HTTP status codes (201, 200, 204, 400, 404, 409, 500)
- Request validation before service calls (lines 14-16)
- Company ID from JWT token (req.user!.companyId) - correct multi-tenancy

**CompanyController** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/controllers/company.controller.ts`):
- Consistent error handling pattern
- Proper use of authentication context
- Clean, readable code

**ROUTE LAYER QUALITY:**

**User Routes** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/routes/user.routes.ts`):
- Middleware composition: authenticate → requirePermission → controller
- GET routes accessible to all authenticated users (correct for read operations)
- POST/PUT/DELETE require MANAGE_USERS permission (correct RBAC)

**Company Routes** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/routes/company.routes.ts`):
- PUT requires MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS (OWNER/ADMIN only) - correct
- GET accessible to all authenticated users - correct

**ERROR HANDLING:**

Custom error classes (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/utils/errors.ts`):
- Simple, extendable design
- Clear semantic names (ValidationError, NotFoundError, ConflictError)
- Consistent use across all services and controllers

**ISSUE: Minor - Error Details Exposure**
Controllers return generic "Internal server error" on 500 errors (good for security), but logging is missing. Production systems should log actual errors for debugging.

**RECOMMENDATION: Add error logging**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error in createUser:', error); // Add this
  if (error instanceof ConflictError) {
    return res.status(409).json({ error: error.message });
  }
  return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
}
```

### Security Analysis

**AUTHENTICATION:**
- All API routes protected with `authenticate` middleware
- JWT token validation via JWTService
- Proper 401 responses for missing/invalid tokens
- Bearer token format enforced

**AUTHORIZATION (RBAC):**
- Permission-based access control (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/utils/rbac.ts`)
- Role hierarchy properly defined:
  - FIELD_WORKER: view/edit own time only
  - FOREMAN: + crew time, approve time
  - PROJECT_MANAGER: + all time, projects, financials
  - ADMIN: + manage users, integrations, export payroll
  - OWNER: all permissions
- Middleware correctly blocks unauthorized access (403 responses)
- Authorization tests verify FIELD_WORKER cannot access privileged operations

**DATA ISOLATION:**
- Company scoping on all operations (companyId from JWT)
- Prevents cross-company data access
- Soft delete filtering prevents access to deleted records

**PASSWORD SECURITY:**
- Bcrypt with 12 rounds (strong)
- Passwords sanitized from all API responses
- Private `sanitizeUser` method ensures no accidental exposure

**POTENTIAL SECURITY ISSUES:**

**CRITICAL - None**

**IMPORTANT - None**

**SUGGESTIONS:**
1. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting middleware to prevent brute force (future enhancement)
2. **Input Validation Library**: Consider adding Zod/Joi for schema validation (current validation is manual)
3. **SQL Injection**: Using Prisma ORM (parameterized queries) - already protected
4. **CSRF**: Not applicable for stateless JWT API
5. **CORS**: Helmet + CORS middleware already configured in index.ts

**VERDICT: PRODUCTION-READY SECURITY**

### Test Coverage Analysis

**TEST ORGANIZATION:**

Service Tests:
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/services/user.service.test.ts` (5 tests)
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/services/company.service.test.ts` (7 tests)

Integration Tests:
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/user.api.test.ts` (18 tests)
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/company.api.test.ts` (7 tests)

**TOTAL: 41 tests (100% passing)**

**SERVICE TEST QUALITY:**

UserService Tests:
- createUser: success case, duplicate email
- getUserById: success, not found
- listUsers: basic listing
- Missing: updateUser tests, deleteUser tests, listUsers filtering

CompanyService Tests:
- getCompany: success, not found, deleted company
- updateCompany: name update, settings update, not found, deleted company
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

**INTEGRATION TEST QUALITY:**

User API Tests:
- Authentication tests (401 scenarios) - 4 tests
- Authorization tests (403 scenarios) - 3 tests
- CRUD operations (200/201/204) - 6 tests
- Error handling (400, 404, 409) - 3 tests
- Soft delete verification - 1 test
- Password hash exclusion verification - 1 test

Company API Tests:
- Authentication tests (401 scenarios) - 2 tests
- Authorization tests (403 for FIELD_WORKER) - 1 test
- GET/PUT operations with OWNER - 3 tests
- PUT with ADMIN role - 1 test
- Proper cleanup in all tests

**TEST QUALITY METRICS:**
- Setup/Teardown: Proper beforeAll/afterAll in all test suites
- Data Cleanup: All tests clean up created data
- Isolation: Tests don't depend on each other
- Real Database: Tests run against actual Postgres (not mocks)
- Assertions: Clear, specific assertions

**ISSUE: Important - Missing Service Tests**
UserService is missing tests for:
- `updateUser` method
- `deleteUser` method
- `listUsers` filtering (role, status, search parameters)

While integration tests cover these paths, unit tests are important for:
1. Testing edge cases in isolation
2. Faster test execution
3. Better error message clarity

**RECOMMENDATION: Add missing UserService tests**
Priority: Medium (integration tests provide coverage, but service tests would improve maintainability)

### Code Maintainability

**NAMING CONVENTIONS:**
- Services: `UserService`, `CompanyService` (clear, consistent)
- Controllers: `UserController`, `CompanyController` (clear, consistent)
- Routes: `user.routes.ts`, `company.routes.ts` (clear, consistent)
- Methods: camelCase, descriptive (createUser, getUserById, etc.)

**CODE ORGANIZATION:**
- Logical file structure: services/, controllers/, routes/, utils/, middleware/
- One class per file
- Related functionality grouped together
- Clear import organization

**DOCUMENTATION:**
- No inline comments (code is self-documenting)
- No JSDoc comments (could be added for API documentation generation)

**SUGGESTION: Add JSDoc comments for public methods**
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new user in the system
 * @param data User creation data
 * @returns Created user (without password hash)
 * @throws ConflictError if email already exists
 */
async createUser(data: { ... }) { ... }
```

**READABILITY:**
- Functions are short and focused (most under 20 lines)
- Minimal nesting
- Clear error handling flow
- Consistent formatting

**TECHNICAL DEBT:**
- None identified
- Clean code throughout
- No TODO comments
- No commented-out code

## 3. ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### Overall Architecture Assessment

**ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: Layered + MVC**

```
Request
  → Routes (routing + middleware composition)
    → Controller (HTTP handling, request/response)
      → Service (business logic)
        → Prisma ORM (data access)
          → PostgreSQL
```

**STRENGTHS:**
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibility
2. **Testability**: Service layer can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Services can be called from multiple controllers
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new endpoints/services
5. **Maintainability**: Changes isolated to relevant layers

**MIDDLEWARE ARCHITECTURE:**

Middleware stack (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/index.ts`):
```
helmet() → cors() → express.json() → morgan() → routes
```

Route-level middleware:
```
authenticate → requirePermission → controller
```

**EXCELLENT:** Middleware composition is clean and follows Express best practices.

### Integration Quality

**APPLICATION INTEGRATION** (`/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/index.ts`):
```typescript
app.use('/api/v1/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/company', companyRoutes);
```

**CLEAN INTEGRATION:**
- RESTful URL structure
- API versioning (v1)
- Consistent routing pattern
- No route conflicts

**SERVICE INTEGRATION:**

UserService dependencies:
- Prisma ORM (database)
- Bcrypt (password hashing)
- Custom error classes

CompanyService dependencies:
- Prisma ORM (database)
- Custom error classes

**NO CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES - EXCELLENT**

**CONTROLLER INTEGRATION:**

Controllers depend on:
- Services (business logic)
- Middleware types (AuthRequest)
- Error classes (error handling)

**CLEAN DEPENDENCY GRAPH:**
```
Controllers → Services → Prisma → Database
     ↓
  Utilities (errors, RBAC)
```

**DATABASE SCHEMA ALIGNMENT:**

Prisma schema models:
- Company: id, name, subscriptionTier, settings, deletedAt
- User: id, companyId, email, name, role, status, deletedAt

Service operations align perfectly with schema:
- All fields properly typed
- Soft delete support (deletedAt checks)
- Foreign key relationships respected (companyId)

**NO SCHEMA MISMATCHES FOUND**

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- Consistent across all controllers
- Custom error classes for semantic errors
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error propagation from service to controller

**LOGGING:**
- Morgan middleware for HTTP request logging
- Missing: Application-level error logging (see recommendation above)

**AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION:**
- Centralized in middleware
- Reusable across all routes
- RBAC properly enforced
- JWT validation secure

**MULTI-TENANCY:**
- Company scoping on all operations
- companyId from JWT token (trusted source)
- No cross-company data leakage possible

---

## 4. PRODUCTION READINESS

### Performance Considerations

**DATABASE QUERIES:**
- Using Prisma ORM (optimized queries)
- Proper indexes in schema (companyId, email, role)
- Soft delete filtering adds WHERE clause (minimal overhead)
- Transaction used in updateUser (correctness over raw speed - acceptable)

**POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATION:**
```typescript
// Current: Two DB calls in updateUser
const user = await tx.user.findFirst({ where: { id, companyId, deletedAt: null } });
if (!user) throw new NotFoundError('User not found');
return tx.user.update({ where: { id }, data });

// Alternative: Try update first, check affected rows
// More efficient but less clear error messages
```

**VERDICT:** Current approach prioritizes clarity and correct error handling over micro-optimizations. Acceptable for production.

**MEMORY USAGE:**
- No memory leaks identified
- Prisma connection pooling handled
- No unbounded arrays/collections
- Test warning about worker process suggests connection cleanup (see below)

**SCALABILITY:**
- Stateless API (horizontal scaling ready)
- No in-memory state
- Database connection pooling
- Ready for load balancer deployment

### Error Handling & Resilience

**HTTP ERROR RESPONSES:**
- 200: Success (GET, PUT)
- 201: Created (POST)
- 204: No Content (DELETE)
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
- 401: Unauthorized (missing/invalid token)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found (resource not found)
- 409: Conflict (duplicate email)
- 500: Internal Server Error (unexpected errors)

**COMPREHENSIVE AND CORRECT**

**ERROR RECOVERY:**
- Database transaction rollback in updateUser
- No partial state changes
- Proper cleanup in tests

**MISSING: Retry Logic**
- No retry for transient database errors
- Recommendation: Add retry middleware for production (optional)

### Deployment Readiness

**ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:**
- `.env` support via dotenv
- Environment variables: DATABASE_URL, PORT, NODE_ENV
- Test mode detection (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test')

**HEALTH CHECK:**
```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'healthy', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});
```

**SUGGESTION: Enhanced health check**
```typescript
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`; // Database health
    res.json({ status: 'healthy', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(503).json({ status: 'unhealthy', error: 'Database connection failed' });
  }
});
```

**DOCKER READINESS:**
- Port configurable via environment (PORT || 3000)
- No hard-coded paths
- Database URL from environment

**SECURITY HEADERS:**
- Helmet middleware configured (XSS, MIME sniffing, clickjacking protection)
- CORS enabled
- Ready for production

**ISSUE: Minor - Test Warning**
Test output shows:
```
A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited.
This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown.
```

**CAUSE:** Likely Prisma connection not fully closed in one of the test suites.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Ensure all test files have:
```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  // ... cleanup ...
  await prisma.$disconnect();
});
```

Already present in all test files - may need to add small delay or ensure sequential execution.

---

## 5. ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Issues
**NONE IDENTIFIED**

### Important Issues

**ISSUE 1: Missing UserService Unit Tests**
- Severity: Medium
- Impact: Reduced test coverage for updateUser, deleteUser, listUsers filtering
- Recommendation: Add 5-8 additional service tests
- Priority: Medium (integration tests provide coverage)

### Suggestions

**SUGGESTION 1: Add Error Logging**
```typescript
// In all controllers
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error in ${methodName}:`, error); // Add this
  // ... existing error handling
}
```

**SUGGESTION 2: Add JSDoc Comments**
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new user in the system
 * @param data User creation data
 * @returns Created user without password hash
 * @throws ConflictError if email already exists
 */
async createUser(data: { ... }) { ... }
```

**SUGGESTION 3: Enhanced Health Check**
Add database connectivity check to health endpoint (see code above)

**SUGGESTION 4: Input Validation Library**
Consider adding Zod or Joi for schema validation:
```typescript
const createUserSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(1),
  role: z.enum(['FIELD_WORKER', 'FOREMAN', ...]),
  phoneNumber: z.string().optional()
});
```

**SUGGESTION 5: API Documentation**
Generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs from JSDoc comments for API consumers

**SUGGESTION 6: Fix Test Warning**
Investigate Prisma connection cleanup in tests to eliminate worker process warning

## Review (RBAC Authorization Tests)

### Implementation Summary

All RBAC authorization tests have been successfully implemented and are passing.

#### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/user.api.test.ts`

1. **Added Variable Declarations** (lines 11-12):
   - `fieldWorkerUserId: string`
   - `fieldWorkerToken: string`

2. **Enhanced beforeAll Setup** (lines 39-54):
   - Created FIELD_WORKER user with email 'worker@test.com'
   - Generated password hash using bcrypt
   - Authenticated field worker using AuthService
   - Obtained and stored access token for use in tests

3. **Added POST Authorization Test** (lines 133-145):
   - Tests that FIELD_WORKER role cannot create users
   - Verifies 403 status code is returned
   - Confirms error message contains "Insufficient permissions"

4. **Added PUT Authorization Test** (lines 245-267):
   - Tests that FIELD_WORKER role cannot update users
   - Creates temporary test user for update attempt
   - Verifies 403 status code with appropriate error message
   - Includes proper cleanup of test data

5. **Added DELETE Authorization Test** (lines 312-331):
   - Tests that FIELD_WORKER role cannot delete users
   - Creates temporary test user for delete attempt
   - Verifies 403 status code with appropriate error message
   - Includes proper cleanup of test data

6. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Field worker user is automatically cleaned up in existing afterAll hook
   - All test users created during tests are properly deleted

#### Test Results

**All 18 tests passed successfully:**

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       18 passed, 18 total
Time:        7.058 s
```

**New Tests Added (3):**
1. POST /api/v1/users - should return 403 for user without MANAGE_USERS permission ✓
2. PUT /api/v1/users/:id - should return 403 for user without MANAGE_USERS permission ✓
3. DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - should return 403 for user without MANAGE_USERS permission ✓

#### Key Implementation Details

1. **Simplicity**: Changes were minimal and focused only on adding the required tests
2. **Consistency**: Followed existing test patterns in the file exactly
3. **Reusability**: Created field worker user once in beforeAll, reused token across all tests
4. **Proper Cleanup**: All test data is properly cleaned up to avoid test pollution
5. **No Code Changes**: No changes to application code were needed - tests verify existing RBAC implementation

#### Verification

The tests successfully verify that:
- Users without MANAGE_USERS permission (FIELD_WORKER role) receive 403 Forbidden responses
- The error messages correctly indicate "Insufficient permissions"
- Authorization checks work across all write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- The existing RBAC middleware is functioning correctly

#### Security Impact

These tests close a critical security testing gap by verifying that privilege escalation is properly prevented. The tests confirm that the RBAC system correctly enforces permission boundaries and unauthorized users cannot perform administrative operations.

## Review (Previous Task - Users API REST Endpoints)

### Implementation Summary

Task 2 (Users API - REST Endpoints) has been successfully completed following TDD principles.

#### What Was Implemented

1. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/user.api.test.ts`)
   - 15 comprehensive tests covering all CRUD operations
   - Tests for authentication requirements (401 errors)
   - Tests for validation errors (400, 404, 409 errors)
   - Tests for soft delete behavior

2. **User Controller** (`src/controllers/user.controller.ts`)
   - `createUser` - POST endpoint with validation and error handling
   - `getUser` - GET single user by ID
   - `listUsers` - GET all users with optional filtering
   - `updateUser` - PUT endpoint for updating user details
   - `deleteUser` - DELETE endpoint for soft deleting users
   - Uses custom error classes (NotFoundError, ConflictError, ValidationError)
   - Proper HTTP status codes (201, 200, 204, 400, 404, 409, 500)

3. **User Routes** (`src/routes/user.routes.ts`)
   - All routes protected with authentication middleware
   - POST, PUT, DELETE protected with RBAC (MANAGE_USERS permission)
   - GET routes accessible to all authenticated users
   - Proper route parameter handling

4. **Main App Integration** (`src/index.ts`)
   - Mounted user routes at `/api/v1/users`
   - Routes properly integrated with existing auth routes

#### Test Results

**Automated Tests:**
- 15/15 tests passed (100% pass rate)
- All test suites passing
- Tests cover:
  - Creating users (with and without auth)
  - Listing users (with and without auth)
  - Getting user by ID (existing and non-existent)
  - Updating users (existing and non-existent)
  - Deleting users (soft delete verification)
  - Input validation
  - Duplicate email detection

**Manual Tests (curl):**
- ✓ POST /api/v1/users - User created successfully (201)
- ✓ GET /api/v1/users - Listed all users correctly
- ✓ GET /api/v1/users/:id - Retrieved specific user
- ✓ PUT /api/v1/users/:id - Updated user details
- ✓ DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - Soft deleted user (204)
- ✓ Verified soft delete - Deleted user not in list

#### Files Created
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/tests/integration/user.api.test.ts`
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/routes/user.routes.ts`

#### Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/Users/dat1k/Construction/crewflow-backend/src/index.ts` (added user routes)

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Error Handling**: Used custom error classes from Task 1 for consistent error handling
2. **Security**: All routes require authentication, sensitive operations require MANAGE_USERS permission
3. **Data Sanitization**: Password hashes never exposed in API responses (handled by UserService)
4. **Soft Deletes**: DELETE operations soft delete (set deletedAt) rather than hard delete
5. **Company Isolation**: All operations scoped to user's company (companyId from JWT token)

#### No Issues Encountered

Implementation went smoothly:
- UserService from Task 1 already had all necessary methods
- Custom error classes integrated seamlessly
- RBAC middleware worked as expected
- All tests passed on first run after implementation

#### Ready for Production

The Users API is fully functional with:
- Complete CRUD operations
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Clean separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Database)
