## Risk Mitigation

### HIGH RISK: Timeline Slippage
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on Core Platform completion (Weeks 5-8)
- Parallelize other tracks only after Core Platform stable
- Consider reducing scope of Intelligence Layer for MVP

### MEDIUM RISK: Offline Sync Complexity
**Mitigation:**
- Allocate 4 full weeks (Weeks 9-12)
- Consider using proven library (WatermelonDB, Realm)
- Extensive testing with real devices

### MEDIUM RISK: Mobile Platform Differences
**Mitigation:**
- Test on both iOS and Android frequently
- Use platform-specific code sparingly
- Hire experienced React Native developer if needed

### LOW RISK: QuickBooks API Changes
**Mitigation:**
- Version locking
- Subscribe to API change notifications
- Maintain good test coverage
